# Coffee Shop Analysis
### Python for Data Analyst | Team Assignment Grade: 86/100
### Professor Comment:
Strengths:

Clean, well-documented code with descriptive variable names.
Strong visualizations and practical recommendations.

Weaknesses/Areas of improvement:

Graphs missing labels or legends.
Some generic variable names (e.g., df, Q3).
Content: Relevant but lacks supporting details in some areas (e.g., unlabeled graphs). 
Organization: Generally clear and covers main points, though visualization issues detract. 
Conclusion: Clear and supported, but not compelling enough. 
 

Well-documented but needs refinement in visual presentation and variable naming.
### Assignment Instructions:
Objective:

In this group assignment, students will collaborate to analyze a business dataset using Python, drawing insights, and making data-driven business recommendations. The assignment emphasizes teamwork and individual contributions within the group.

 

Instructions:

· Dataset: Each group will find an approved business-related dataset (e.g., sales, customer behavior, or financial data).

· Libraries: Use the following Python libraries to complete the assignment:

o pandas (for data manipulation and cleaning)

o matplotlib and seaborn (for visualization)

o numpy (for numerical operations)

o scikit-learn (for basic predictive analysis, if applicable)

 

Presentation Structure:

Each group will present their findings, with each member responsible for a specific part of the analysis during session 7. This division ensures individual grading for each student.

1. Introduction and Business Problem Overview (Person 1): Briefly introduce the business problem the group is addressing with data analysis.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Person 2): Explain how the data was cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis (e.g., handling missing values, outliers, etc.).

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Person 3): Present summary statistics and key visualizations (e.g., correlation heatmaps, distributions) using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

4. Advanced Analysis or Modeling (Person 4): If applicable, present any advanced analysis (e.g., predictive modeling) using scikit-learn. Discuss the model’s performance and any key findings.

5. Business Insights and Recommendations (Person 5): Based on the data analysis, provide actionable business recommendations, and tie them back to the original problem.

6. Conclusion (Person 6, if applicable): Summarize the key findings.

 

Deliverables:

· Python Notebook: A single group notebook containing the code and analysis for submission.

· Presentation: A 10-minute group presentation.

 

Key Evaluation Criteria:

1. Team Collaboration: The group will be evaluated on how effectively members worked together to divide tasks, contribute to the analysis, and present their findings as a cohesive team.

2. Correct Use of Python Libraries: The overall assessment will focus on the technical accuracy and depth of the data analysis, ensuring that appropriate Python libraries (‘pandas’, ‘matplotlib,’ ‘seaborn,’ ‘numpy,’ and ‘scikit-learn,’ if applicable) are used effectively.

3. Quality of Insights: The team will be judged on the relevance and depth of the business insights and recommendations derived from the data analysis, and how well these insights are tied back to the original business problem.

4. Presentation Skills: The clarity, structure, and professionalism of the group’s presentation will be assessed, including how well the analysis is communicated.
